    <h2>Kotlin Programming Language in Android Development</h2>
    <p>
        Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise.
    </p>
    <b>
        Kotlin is a modern, trending programming language. Kotlin is easy to learn, especially if you already know Java (it is 100% compatible with Java). Kotlin is used to develop Android apps, server side apps, and much more.
