        The proverb has deep meaning, which is always useful for a successful life. It conveys the idea that we should
        always think and then act accordingly. Impulsive actions may lead us to embarrassing and odd situations. As we
        should always think before we speak, in the same way we should think before we act. Life is full of various
        factors, the factors which can fascinate us for the moment but may lead us to failure or the factors which can
        repel immediately but may be the stepping stones to success. For example, going to a movie or playing video
        games may seem an attractive thing for the time being but can, in the course of time not only disturb oneâ€™s
        studies but also injure our eyes. Therefore, we should always restrain our intuitive and impulsive desires and
        then act according to what our mind says is right. Even the great men like <b> Gandhi. Nehru, John Kennedy
        </b>have been
        prey to their passions and emotions due to which the nations suffered. We should learn from their lives and
        should always act thoughtfully.
